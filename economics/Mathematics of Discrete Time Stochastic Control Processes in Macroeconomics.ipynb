    "The goal of this work is to systematize the mathematics used in economic modeling, starting with dynamic stochastic optimization problems in microeconomics and building towards heterogeneous agent models (HAM) of partial or general equilibria. This will also explore the ways these models can be used for population simulation with the birth and death of agents.\n",

In these other disciplines, the formal complexity properties of these processes are well studied, and often there are already tools available for computional estimation and/or execution of these processes. If these connections can be made, it stands to reason that they would likely helpfully inform the design of Econ-ARK, a software toolkit for structural modeling of HAMs.\n",

    "Here is a simple example of such a problem, the idiosyncratic income shock model. The consumer controls their consumption $c$ at each time step and gets utility $u(c)$ each period that they consumer. The consumer consumes out of a stock of resources $m$ that is replenished by income. The consumer receives two income shocks at the beginning of each period: a completely transitory shock $\\theta$ and a completely permanent shock $\\psi$.  Moreover, the agent is subject to borrowing a borrowing limit: the ratio of end-of-period assets $A_t$ to permanent income $P_t$ must be greater than $\\text{$\\underline{a}$}$.  As with the perfect foresight problem, this model is stated in terms of *normalized* variables, dividing all real variables by $P_t$:\n",

However, this form compresses how the problem can be seen as consisting of several mathematically distinct elements. What follows are observations about this example which generalize across other problems in this space, and to the theory of dynamic programming more generally.\n",

It is an analytic reduction of the true Bellman Form of the problem, which defines the value of a state as the maximum, over all the control variables, of the utility at this time period plus the recursively discounted utility at the next period.\n",

    "Here, we have turned $m$ into a function of $c$, though this depends on our understanding that $m_{t+1}$ is a stochastic function that depends on all of the transition equations and conditions of the problem formulation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the maximization term in the definition of $v_t$ is over one particular variable of interests, in this case consumption $c$. This is the control variable or action variable of the agent. The fact that it is positioned here, under the maximization term, distinguishes it as the variable over which the agent must optimize. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, there are several other variables including the domain of $v$ and random variables that are connected to the control variable $c$ via several equations and conditions. We we call these variables _model variables_ and the equations and conditions _structural equations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are still far from general theory. What we have are the following terms:\n",
    " * a time index $t$\n",
    " * a set of _model variables_, which includes a _control variable_\n",

    "    - which is a maximization over the control variable\n",

    "This structure suggests that the problem is a special case of a _discrete time stochastic control process_. The integral time index $t$ is _discrete time_. The problem is a _control process_ because the question is how to optimally set the control variable in each discrete time step in order to maximize some value function. It is _stochastic_ because some of the model variables are random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps because of the disciplinary distance between economics and the control theory that defines a _discrete time stochastic control process_, it is not immediately obvious how these kinds of models, which I will call _Bellman form structural equation models_ (BFSEM), relate to the more general control theory."

    "\n",
    "However, the two formalisms are not identical. Most notably, the probability distribtion $P$ and the structural equations $E$ are different forms of mathematical entities. This key difference in the two formalisms leads to other subtle differences in the models.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Proposition 1. For every well-formed BFSEM, there exists an equivalent MDP.`\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposition is not yet fully specified. By \"well-formed\", we mean adhering to the currently miscellaneous constraints suggested at the end of the previous section. By \"equivalent\" we mean something like: the models are isomorphic; the decision rules for the BFSEM can be transformed to decision rules for the MDP by a bijection; and the optimal decision rule for the BFSEM and for the MDP will have the same discounted expected utility for the agent. Fleshing out the specifics of this proposition is work that remains to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will prove Proposition 1, or some better specified variation of it, by construction. In roder to do so, we will need to inspect and compare the two formalisms more carefully.\n",

    "First, consider the model states. $S$ for the MDP and $\\mathcal{S}$ for the BFSEM have been given different fonts lest they be confused. Indeed, the notation here can be confusing! In the MDP, $S$ is the set of all possible values of the model state at time $t$. In the BFSEM, $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all of the model state variables. The latter is perhaps underspecified, because the model state variables have not been given domains. But we can see that whereas $m$, the market resources available to the agent, can be a member of the set $\\mathcal{S}$, it cannot be a member of the set $\\mathcal{S}$, which is a set of state _values_, not state _variables_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the idiosyncratic shock model used as an example above, $\\mathcal{S} = (m, a, \\psi, \\theta, \\Gamma)$. Each of these variables ranges over the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the state _space_ of the model $S$ is $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the idiosyncratic shock BFSEM control variables are $C = {c}$, but the value of the variable $c$ ranges over $\\mathbb{R}$, and so the action space $A = \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this transformation is made, it becomes easier to see the correspondence between the BFSEM and MDP. The variable notation used in the BFSEM can now be used as a way of organizing the representation of the MDP state and action space, giving each dimension of state and action a name. This is helpful when specifying the transition and reward functions $P$ and $R$. This also reveals that for a BFSEM, each variable in $\\mathcal{S}$ and $C$ must be given a domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the utility and reward functions $U$ and $R$, it is now easier to map their equivalence. $R: A \\times S \\times S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. $U: dom(C) \\times dom(\\mathcal{S}) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Since $A = dom(C)$ and $S = dom(\\mathcal(S))$, it is clear that for any $U$, an equivalent $R$ can be constructed such that its third term is irrelevant to its output. MDPs provide additional expressive range to the reward function which is not needed by BFSEMs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The essential feature of both MDPs and BFSEMs is that they are control/optimization problems, raising the question of how an agent can perform optimally given limited control over the system. As noted, $A = dom(C)$ for the purpose of drawing an equivalence between an MDP and a BFSEM. But what does that mean for the policy $\\pi$?\n",

    " - Determine next state $s' ~ Pr(s' | s, a)$\n",
    " - Repeat with $s = s'$\n",
    " \n",
    "In a BFSEM, it is a little more complicated because the action space is in principle broken up into distinct control variables, and these control variables can be ordered within a period by virtue of how they are used in the structural equations $E$. Indeed, the modeler may wish to constrain the information available to the agent at each point of control separately.\n",

    "It may be best, therefore, to introduce the following constraint as part of what it means to be a \"well-formed\" BFSEM:\n",

    "     - Example: In the idiosyncratic shock case, $Pa(c) = \\{m\\}$\n",
    " - A _decision rule_ for a variable $v$, $\\delta_v$, is a function of the values of the parents of $v$. I.e., $\\delta_v: dom(Pa(v)) \\rightarrow v$.\n",
    "     - in a more general formulation, $\\delta$ would be a probability distribution rather than a deterministic function.\n",
    " - A complete _policy_ for a BFSEM is a set of decision rules for all control variables, i.e. $\\pi_v = \\delta_v$.\n",
    " \n",
    "In the graphical model above, the consumption variable $c$ was depicted with a square instead of a circle; that was to denote that it is a control variable.
