    "## Notes on empirics and economic simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "From meeting with CDC 5/11/22\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two broad approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Two extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Econometrics_. A focus on stable causal relationships in data. Using strong assumptions of linear causation. Ensure exogenous causation by focusing on the problem of _identification_.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Structural models_.  Requires understanding the key things the model will accomplish. What are the key empirical facts? What structural mechanism will be illuminated? There might be (endogenous) stylized facts. Example: \"Distribution of Wealtha and the Marginal Propensity to Consume\" -- need model to match high-level fact then let time preference be what's adjusted (assuming time preference is uniformly distributed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unifying third way: Indirect inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try to make all the choices rigorous.\n",
    "- Set all moments of distributions to match\n",
    "- pay attention to statistical degrees of uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle plays out: it's hard to reach clairty about identification in these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Testfatsion: 'validation of ABMs\" -- refering to whether the model of agent behavior corresponds to what we think they are doing. For non-rational approaches. No systematized use of evidence yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HARK and SHARK\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply indirect inference to a whole model:\n",
    " - decide which aspects of the model are estimable\n",
    " - find which values of the estimable values create target features that match the data -- \"stylized facts\"\n",
    " \n",
    "In SHARKFin, if volatility is independnet of the consumer, we get separabel indirect inference problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system $S$ includes components $C_1$ and $C_2$. The components can be validated separately, then combined into $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ABM people may make up the agent behavior when there are good rules of thumb about the micofoundations\n",
    "- Economists are more interested in behaviors that can be derived from an optimizing process. "
