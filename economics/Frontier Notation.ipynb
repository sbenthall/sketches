    "### Bellman Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Bellman equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation) is a formulation of the value to an agent of each state acting optimally within a dynamic decision problem. From this value function it is easy to compute the optimal policy for the agent. It has been \"discovered\" and used in many fields, and goes by many names and notational variations across disciplines (Powell, 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bellman equation takes the form (**Definition 1**):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(x) = \\text{max}_{a \\in \\Gamma(x)} F(x,a) + \\beta V(T(x,a))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $a \\in A$, the set of actions available\n",
    "* $x \\in X$, the set of states\n",
    "* $\\Gamma : X \\rightarrow \\mathscr{B}(A)$ constraints the actions available in state X\n",
    "* $F: X \\times A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the payoff to the agent of taking action $a$ in state $x$\n",
    "* $T: X \\times A \\rightarrow X$ is a transition function determining the state in the next period\n",
    "* $\\beta$ is a discount factor on future payoffs. **Maybe $\\beta: X \\times A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation of Bellman equation assumes a deterministic model. If T is a stochastic function, $T_{i,j}: X_i \\times A_i \\rightarrow P(X_j)$, as it is in many cases in economics, then the value function is defined in terms of expectations. (**Definition 2**):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(x) = \\text{max}_{a \\in \\Gamma(x)} F(x,a) + E[\\beta  V(T(x,a))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the deterministic version of this equation for simplicity unless there's a good reason to use the probabilistic version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: Define a policy $\\pi$**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time and finitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above definitions, there is only one state space, action space, value function, etc. that is repeated \"over time\". However, it is possible to model \"changes over time\" within this formalism by including an indicator of the \"time\" within the model in the state space. While these definitions are in this sense perfectly general, various desiderata have made alternative or reduced variations of this formalism desireable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though perhaps a source of confusion, we will note that the time index is often used explicitly in the definition of the Bellman equation, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_t(x) = \\text{max}_{a \\in \\Gamma(x)} F(x,a) + E[\\beta  V_{t+1}(T(x,a))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially the case when the equation is more \"worked out\" and the state space is articulated in terms of model variables (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The explicit representation of time encourages the articulation of \"finite horizon\" models which have a notional maximal time limit. In theory, this is accomodated by the formalism above by stipulating that for all $\\hat{t} > K$, $V_{\\hat{t}} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, as we constrain the space of Bellman problems to classes of problems with certain shared features, we can develop general solution algorithms that are more efficient at solving the problems. This motivates a deeper investigation of Bellman equations and their use in, e.g., economics."

    "### Solving the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic background material on solution algorithms for Bellman problems.\n",
    "For now this assumes discrete problem spaces, though we will ultimately be interested in continuous problem spaces.\n",
    "**For now, I will presume that the time complexity of continuous problem solutions is comparable to the time complexity of their discretizations. Eventually I will include a formal analysis of this elaborating on e.g. Carroll (2006).**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Value Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest algorithm for solving a problem in Bellman form is **value iteration**.\n",
    "There are many varitions of value iteration. For the purposes of this preliminery analysis, we will examine one of the simplest.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize $V(x) \\leftarrow 0$ for all $x \\in X$. (This initialization can be to any arbitrary value for an infinite horizon problem.)\n",
    "2. Iteratively update until $\\forall x, |V(x) - V'(s)| < 0$:\n",
    "   1. $V' \\leftarrow V$\n",
    "   2. For all $x \\in X$:\n",
    "       1. For each $a \\in \\Gamma(x)$:\n",
    "          1. compute $Q(a,x) \\leftarrow F(x,a) + E[\\beta  V'(T(x,a))$\n",
    "       2. $V(x) \\leftarrow \\text{max}_{a \\in \\Gamma(x)} Q(a,x)$\n",
    "3. Output optimal policy $\\pi^*(x) \\leftarrow \\text{argmax}_{a \\in \\Gamma(x)} F(x,a) + E[\\beta  V(T(x,a)) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The computationally expensive part of value iteration is the update step (2.2). As written, the time complexity of one update step is $O(|X|^2|A|)$: a loop over the state space, a loop over the action space, and a final loop over the state space again in (2.2.1.1) to computer the expectated value from the next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted here that the algorithm implementation can take advantage of the sparsity of the problem. Not every combination of $(x, a, x')$ need be explored at each update step. Let $X'(x) = {x' |\\exists a \\in A, T(x,a)(x') > 0}$, the set of states in the next period that have a positive probability under the distribution $T(x,a)$. Then the complexity of the update step (2.2) for a given $x$ is reduced to $O(|\\Gamma(x)||X'(x)|)$. Moreover, after a single pass ofr the state space at (2), it is possible to determine if some of the notional elements of $X$ are in fact never reached, and these can be excluded from future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of when a transition function will be sparse is when the \"state\" includes a variable that tracks the \"time period\" of the problem, $t$. As this model variable increments once per period with $T$, it adds no \"width\" to the problem at (2.2.1.1), and so can be added or removed without increasing the time complexity of the solution. In fact, the inclusion of this \"variable\" is often elevated to a role in primary notation, distinguishing different iterations of the problem's updating or simulation function, or as an alternative to the \"prime\" notation. As the use of this \"time\" notation has caused confusion in the past, where possible we will avoid it in these architecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backwards induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Backwards induction is in many respects even simpler than value iteration. In finite cases, the value function at each step can be computed directly starting with the terminal case. This looks much like value iteration as described above except that:\n",
    " * whereas in value iteration the initial $V$ is arbitrary, in the backwards induction case $V_K$ is given by the model definition.\n",
    " * whereas in value iteration the intermediary computed value functions are discarded, in backwards they are stored as $V_t$ is the unique solution at the $t$ time step."

    "\n",

Here $C$ is a control variable because it is notionally chosen by the agent to maximize the value of the value function $V$. Control variables are thus related to the action space $A$ but not identical to it. For example, it is possible to have more than one control variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the transition equations contains symbols (e.g., $Y$, $A$) that are not used in the definitions here. We will call these _state variables_ even though they do not show up in the state space $X$! **Do we need another name for this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good reminder that _transition equations_ here are not the same thing as the _transition function_ $T$ of the Bellman problem, though they have similar names and are clearly connected. This is the source of some confusion. **We will clarify this relationship in later sections of this document.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the substate $P$ never depends on the choice of an action. It grows at a rate of $G$ every period. We call variables that do not depend on an agent's choice _exogenous_ variables. **We will define this more carefully later in this document.**"

    "#### V2. Finite Problems Changing Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a sense in which the challenge of changing over time is similar to the challenge of multiple control points. We will see that the formal descriptions of the challenges are similar. However, there are some differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whereas multiple control points allow us to break a problem down into $C$ subproblems with smaller state and action spaces than the original problem, inconsistency over time makes a problem *more* complex because it *increases* the size of the problem and set of problems that can be represented.\n",
    "2. One of these things will hold for any actually specified inconsistent problem: (a) the inconsistent problem is a finite problem, or (b) the inconsistent problem can be rewritten as a consistent problem with time index in its state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will formally define the time inconsistent problem in terms of the following, assuming for now that it is a finite problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A_0, ..., A_K$ is a sequence of sets of action spaces\n",
    "* $X_0, ...,X_K$ is a sequence of sets of state spaces\n",
    "* $\\Gamma_0, ..., \\Gamma_C$ is a sequence of contraints. $\\Gamma_k: X_k \\rightarrow \\mathscr{B}(A_k)$\n",
    "* $F_0, ..., F_K$ is a sequence reward functions. $F_k: X_k \\times A_k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "* $T_0, ..., T_K$ is a sequence of transitions functions $T_k: X_k \\times A_k \\rightarrow X_{k+1}$, with $T_K$ undefined. (see below for value function construction).\n",
    "* $\\beta_0 , ..., \\beta_K$, a (potentially varying) discount factor for utility between time steps \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific changes to the formalism include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Substance*: Whereas in V1 the problems are defined by mutual recursive with $\\mathit{T_C}: \\mathit{X}_C \\times \\mathit{A}_C \\rightarrow \\mathit{X}_0$, in this case $T_K$ is terminal.\n",
    "* *Notation*: Whereas in V1 the subproblem components were written in a different font `mathit` (**perhaps too subtle a difference; could use mathcal instead?**), these subproblems are not a valid decomposition of single, more complex infinite horizon problem and so use the standard font.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With these sequences of subproblems defined, the Bellman-like *Carroll equations* are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_K(x) = \\text{max}_{a \\in \\Gamma_K(x)} F_K(x,a)$$\n",
    "$$V_k(x) = \\text{max}_{a \\in \\Gamma_k(x)} F_k(x,a) + \\beta_k V_{k+1}(T_k(x,a))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a finite model, this can be solved simply via backwards induction without looking for a convergent value of $V_k$. Note that as before, the transition functions $T_k$ link the problem at $k$ to the state space of the next time $X_{k+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problem for any $k$ carries as much information as one problem in the mode of **Definition 1**, then the time inconsistent problem will have a longer minimum description lengtht than the original infinite horizon problem. This is in contrast to the decomposition of the infinite horizon problem in to multiple stages based on multiple control variables; in the latter case, the decomposition contains no new information."

    "\n",
